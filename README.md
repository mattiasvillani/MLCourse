### Bayesian Learning

### Contents

The course gives a solid introduction to Bayesian statistical inference, with special emphasis on models and methods in computational statistics and machine learning. 
* We will get off to a shocking start by introducing a very different probability concept than the one you are probably (:wink:) used to: subjective probability. 
* We will then move on to the mathematics of the prior-to-posterior updating in basic statistical models, such as the Bernoulli, normal and multinomial models. 
* Bayesian prediction and decision making under uncertainty is carefully explained, and you will hopefully see why Bayesian methods are so useful in modern application where so much focuses on prediction and decision making. 
* The really interesting stuff starts to happen when we study regression and classification. You will learn how prior distributions can be seen as regularization that allows us to use flexible models with many parameters without overfitting the data and improving predictive performance. 
* A new world will open up when we learn how complex models can be analyzed with simulation methods like Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) and approximate optimization methods like Variational Inference (VI).
* You will also get a taste for probabilistic programming languages for Bayesian learning, in particular the popular Stan language in R. 
* Finally, we'll round off with an introduction to Bayesian model selection and Bayesian variable selection.

### Course literature and Schedule

The course will use the following book as the main course literature:

* Gelman, Carlin, Stern, Dunson, Vehtari, Rubin (2014).
Bayesian Data Analysis. Chapman & Hall/CRC: Boca Raton, Florida. 3rd edition.
* Some chapters from a book that I am writing for a courses of this kind.
* Additional course material linked from this page, such as articles and tutorial.

The course schedule on TimeEdit is here: [Schedule](https://cloud.timeedit.net/su/web/stud1/s.html?tab=8&object=cevt_39757&type=courseevent&h=t).

### Computer labs

* The three computer labs are central to the course. Expect to allocate substantial time for each lab. Many of the exam questions will be computer based, so working on the labs will also help you with the exam.
* You are strongly encouraged to do the labs in R, but any programming language is ok to use.
* The labs should be done in **pairs** of students.
* Each lab report should be submitted as a PDF along with the .R file with code. Submission is done through [Athena]().
* There is only two hours of supervised time allocated to each lab. The idea is that you:
  *  should start working on the lab before the computer session
  *  so that you are in a position to ask questions at the session
  *  and then finish up the report after the lab session.
