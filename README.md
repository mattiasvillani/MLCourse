### Page is very much under construction. More material will be added until course starts. The course will be given over Zoom this year. The course will still be great!

### Contents

The course gives a overview of machine learning with a statistical core. It will be quite broad and cover:
* Supervised learning
* Unsupervised learning
* Semi-supervised and active learning

### Course literature and Schedule

The course will use the following book as the main course literature:

* TBD
* Additional course material linked from this page, such as articles and tutorial.

The course schedule on TimeEdit is here: [Schedule](TBA).

### Computer labs

* The three computer labs are central to the course. Expect to allocate substantial time for each lab. Many of the exam questions will be computer based, so working on the labs will also help you with the exam.
* More info to come.
