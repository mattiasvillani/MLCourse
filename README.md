## Introduction and aims

In this course you will learn how to formulate and organize practical machine learning problems, identify and estimate appropriate machine learning models for prediction and clustering, evaluate and select among different machine learning models and algorithms and implement machine learning models and algorithms in a programming language.

The course gives you knowledge about machine learning that is used within marketing, finance, economics, textual analysis, digital humanities and social scienses. You will encounter many different forms of data, including images and text.

The course covers a number of machine learning methods with a focus on prediction. The course deals with supervised and unsupervised machine learning as well as semi-supervised and active learning. The course includes flexible regression and classification, regularization, methods for predictive model performance evaluation, Gaussian processes, clustering algorithms and mixture models.

## Computer labs

* The three computer labs are central to the course. Expect to allocate substantial time for each lab. Many of the exam questions will be computer based, so working on the labs will also help you with the exam.

* R will be used as the course's programming language, see below for more info.

* The labs should be done in pairs of students.

* Each lab report should be submitted as a PDF along with the .R file with code. Submission is done through Athena.

* There is four hours of computer lab time allocated to each lab. The idea is that you: 
  * should start working on the lab before the computer session
  * so that you are in a position to ask questions at the session
  * and then finish up the report after the lab session.

## Examination

The course examination consists of:

* Written lab reports (deadlines given in Athena)
* Computer exam


---

## R

* Analyzing data in R will be big part of the course, so you need to know a little R programming. The course [R programming 7.5 credits](https://www.su.se/english/search-courses-and-programmes/st4101-1.483412) or equivalent course is a prerequisite for this course. If you feel a little rusty on R, you can find a lot of material for studying it online, including tutorials, videos and free books. Here are some material:
  * [Download R](https://www.r-project.org/)
  * [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) - probably the best software/editor for R.
  * [Official introduction to R](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.pdf)
  * [R Cheat sheets](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/)
  * The labs and exam will be done using [R notebooks](https://blog.rstudio.com/2016/10/05/r-notebooks/) in RStudio. 
 
* Here are some machine learning packages in R: 
  * [Machine learning R packages](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/MachineLearning.html) on CRAN.
  * **Caret** - a meta package for predictive ML models in R. See the [Caret package vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/caret/vignettes/caret.html)
 and a list of [available models](https://topepo.github.io/caret/available-models.html) in Caret.
